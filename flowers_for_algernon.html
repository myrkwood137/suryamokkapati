    <h1>Flowers for Algernon</h1>
    <p>Important to note that this is a review of the full novel, not the short story. 
    So many ideas in this book that it, while not difficult to keep track, is tricky to fully put down into a summary. The kind of universal karma from the Algernon-Gordon Effect where the rate of decay is directly proportional to the knowledge increase is
        interesting to think about. the core idea can be expressed in terms of intellectual growth and deterioration:
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
I(t) = I₀ + ΔI(t) - D(t)
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
Where:

I(t) is Charlie's intelligence at time t.
I₀ is his initial intelligence level before the experiment.
ΔI(t) represents the increase in intelligence due to the experiment.
D(t) is the rate of decline after the peak intelligence is reached. Interesting. The idea of cruelty not being a base human construct is also fascinating to consider (I realize now that it is difficult to discuss this book without sounding like a pretentious loser), coming from Charlie being a trusting and kind person to getting increasingly pessimistic and cynical as his intelligence grew.
    The device of him (pre-surgery charlie) looking through a window to see "smart" Charlie is interesting, a parallel to Benji from Faulkner's The Sound and The Fury, where we can see Pre-Surgery Charlie having an obfuscated view of reality. "Through the fence, between the curling flower spaces, I could see them hitting."(Benji) 
        "Through the window, the bride and groom on the wedding cake point at
me and laugh-the air becomes charged with laughter until I can't stand it."(Charlie) "I just wanted to look through
the window."(Charlie) "Through the window-in the clouds-I see Charlie."(Charlie) "Over the arm of
the couch, I caught a glimpse of his face staring back at me through the dark
beyond the window."(Charlie) Something that really interested me was the mental deterioration of his mother, who had once been so quick-witted in contrast to her dim-witted son, now flipped roles, her genius son now outside her house. It chilled me to read "A moment later I could see her peering at me from
behind the sheer white curtain of the door window," with her looking through the window now, not Charlie.
