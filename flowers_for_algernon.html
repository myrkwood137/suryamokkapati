    <h1>Flowers for Algernon</h1>
    <p>Every day I feel more and more like pre-surgery Charlie. 
    So many ideas in this book that it, while not difficult to keep track, is tricky to fully put down into a summary. The kind of universal karma from the Algernon-Gordon Effect where the rate of decay is directly proportional to the knowledge increase is interesting to think about. The idea of cruelty not being a base human construct is also fascinating to consider (I realize now that it is difficult to discuss this book without sounding like a pretentious loser), coming from Charlie being a trusting and kind person to getting increasingly pessimistic and cynical as his intelligence grew. </p>
