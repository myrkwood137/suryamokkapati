    <h1>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</h1>
    <p>
        Very interesting book that tackles some pretty cool projects. Obvious disclaimer that the plot will be discussed.

        The separation of the binary good and evil in a man is an interesting enough concept in its own right, but the idea that evil can be extracted and the remaining person would still be caught in the struggle between good and evil, implying that the base form
        of humanity tends towards evil is interesting to see.
